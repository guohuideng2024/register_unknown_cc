       draft-deng-register-a-reserved-content-coding-value-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a new reserved value unknown for the HTTP
   protocol parameter content coding.  With this value reserved, when
   UA(user agent) doesn't recognize or suppoprt a content encoding value
   from a http response, it exposes unknown content encoding value in
   PerformanceResourceTiming API.

1.  Introduction

   A new field contentEncoding is proposed
   (https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1796) to be added to
   PerformanceResourceTiming (https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/).
   The value of this field explicitly exposes the content encoding value
   in the http response that delivered the resource.  This value is
   beneficial to web sites' and CDNs' content delivery optimization,
   analytics and debugging.

   To ensure that the contentEncoding in PerformanceResourceTiming
   doesn't become a side channel, all arbitary values that are not
   recognized or supported are converted to unknown before exposed in
   PerformanceResourceTiming.  This conversion requires that the
   original value cannot be unknown.

2.  Proposal

   Register a new reserved value unknown for HPPT parameter content
   coding. content coding value cannot be unknown.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Security Considerations

   No security concerns.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a HTTP Content Coding Registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-
   parameters.xhtml).  If this proposal becomes a standard, a new
   reserved value unknown will be added to the registry.
