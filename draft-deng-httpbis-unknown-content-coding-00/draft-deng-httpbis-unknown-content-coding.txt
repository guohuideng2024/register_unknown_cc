1.  Rationale and proposal

   There is a need to convert (https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/
   pull/1796) an arbitary content encoding value from a http response to
   unknown, if the UA(user agent) doesn't recognize or support the
   original content encoding value.  This conversion requires that the
   original value cannot be unknown.

   Therefore, this document proposes a new reserved value unknown for
   the HTTP protocol parameter.  A content coding value cannot be
   unknown.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   No security concerns.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a HTTP Content Coding Registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-
   parameters.xhtml).  If this proposal becomes a standard, a new
   reserved value unknown will be added to the registry.
